## Summary (for CONTEXT / demand)

- Mari saw the entire incident. She was right behind the utility truck, on the phone with her boyfriend; she thought Marcus was going to hit her; he hit the truck instead.
- Traffic was at a standstill because of construction (left lane only). Marcus was coming too fast, didn’t have time to brake, and slammed into the utility truck.
- She called the client (Marcus’s mother). Another lady called 911; an FBI agent was on scene. A man helped sit Marcus down because he kept getting up.
- Mari got out to help: opened the car, grabbed Marcus, saw his head bounce off the steering wheel (she believed he had a concussion). She sat him down, got him water, and got the client’s number from him. Marcus “literally didn’t know he was in an accident.”
- The other person in the utility truck walked out in shock. She had to leave for work and assumed an ambulance was on the way.

That is a fairly new bridge on 1604. So only the left lane is operable they are doing construction on the right side so there was a stand still in traffic because of construction equipment. Well traffic was at a stand still and Marcus was coming too fast didn't have time to break and slammed into a utility truck. I was scared I thought he was going to flip over on bridge. I got off to help your son he opened the car and I grabbed him. I saw his head bounce off the steering wheel so I knew he had concussion.
