# Guardrails: Car Wreck Case Workspace

## Primary goal
Help organize facts and materials for attorney use:
- timelines, evidence indexing, summaries, questions, and drafts.
No legal advice; focus on clarity, completeness, and document-backed statements.

## Non-negotiables
- Never invent facts, dates, names, injuries, or amounts.
- If a detail is unknown, mark as UNKNOWN and add it to open questions.
- Always cite the source file path for each key statement (e.g., /03_evidence/documents/...).
- Separate FACTS from INFERENCES.
- Do not contact anyone; only draft materials.

## Output format rules
- Use headings: Facts, Evidence, Gaps, Next Questions, Draft (if requested).
- When summarizing a doc, include:
  - Doc name + path
  - Date on document
  - Key facts (bullets)
  - Follow-up questions

## Privacy
- Do not include SSNs, full DOB, policy numbers in drafts unless explicitly requested.
- Use initials for non-family witnesses until attorney requests full names.

## Workflow
1) Intake -> 2) Timeline -> 3) Evidence index -> 4) Medical summary -> 5) Attorney packet drafts
