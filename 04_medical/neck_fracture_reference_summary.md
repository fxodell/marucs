## Cervical / neck fracture — points relevant to MVA cases

- **Anatomy:** Cervical spine C1–C7; fractures classified by level (C1, C2, subaxial C3–C7) and mechanism.
- **Mechanisms (force type):** Flexion; flexion-rotation; extension; vertical (axial) compression. High-energy mechanisms include motor vehicle accidents.
- **Whiplash / WAD:** Acceleration–deceleration injury to the neck; whiplash-associated disorder (WAD) is a clinical diagnosis. Structural fracture is a distinct finding (imaging).
- **Evaluation:** History, physical exam, imaging. Fracture may be associated with spinal cord injury; imaging is used to confirm or exclude bony and ligamentous injury.
- **Treatment:** Depends on fracture pattern and stability—ranges from conservative (rest, analgesia, bracing, PT) to surgical. Use the PDF and treating records for case-specific treatment.
- **Prognosis:** Variable by injury type and treatment; document from treating providers and the PDF as needed.

When drafting demand packages or medical summaries, cite the PDF and treating records; use this summary only as a quick reference.
