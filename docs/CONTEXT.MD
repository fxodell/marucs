- Witness account (Mari): Saw entire incident. Was right behind utility truck on 1604 bridge (newest/highest in SA); construction—left lane only, traffic at standstill. Marcus came too fast, no time to brake, slammed utility truck. She got out, helped Marcus (head hit steering wheel; sat him down, water, got client’s number); another person called 911; FBI agent on scene; man helped sit Marcus down (he kept getting up). Marcus “didn’t know he was in an accident.” Other occupant of truck walked out in shock. Mari had to leave for work.
